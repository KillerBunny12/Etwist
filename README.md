# Etwist
 Simple Twitter-esque Social Webpage
 
 This is a project made for my college. It was abaout making a Social Nework webpage using Laravel as BackEnd and Reactjs as Front End.
 The result is a look similar to the one from Twitter, using similar shapes and colors.
 
 This project lets the user connect to a MySQL Database and create Users, Profiles, Posts.
 The main menu lets registered users make posts using text or images/gifs. This is done thanks to an external Image Hoster api using IMGDB
 
 
 
 # BackEnd

The BackEnd was made using Laravel.

# FrontEnd

FrontEnd was made using Reactjs, BootStrap 3 was used for some styles but mostly, it is vanilla CSS.
