# Etwist
 Simple Twitter-esque Social Webpage
 
 This is a project made for my college. It was abaout making a Social Nework webpage using Laravel as BackEnd and Reactjs as Front End.
 The result is a look similar to the one from Twitter, using similar shapes and colors.
 
 
 
 #BackEnd

The BackEnd was made using Laravel.

#FrontEnd

FrontEnd was made using Reactjs, BootStrap 3 was used for some styles but mostly, it is vanilla CSS.
